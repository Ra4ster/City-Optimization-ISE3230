## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to work with the notebook locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ra4ster/City-Optimization-ISE3230.git
cd City-Optimization-ISE3230
```

### 2. Open the Notebook in Jupyter

Use Anaconda's Jupyter launch to find the notebook.

### 3. Making Changes

- Edit the notebook as needed.
- Save your work frequently (`Ctrl+S` or `File > Save` in Jupyter).

### 4. Pushing back to Github

1. Check the status of your repo:
```bash
git status
```
2. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add CityPlanning.ipynb
```
3. Commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```
4. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

> If you cloned this repository and it’s your first push,
> or if there are changes on GitHub you don’t have locally,
> you may need to pull first:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```
### 5. Tips:
- Avoid committing the hidden .ipynb_checkpoints folder. It is already included in .gitignore.
- Keep commit messages clear and descriptive.
- Always pull before pushing if other people might be editing the repo!
